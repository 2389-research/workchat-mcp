# Developer Onboarding Verification

This document verifies that a new developer can post a message to WorkChat in under 15 minutes following the documentation.

## Test Scenario: Complete New Developer Journey

**Goal**: New developer with no prior WorkChat knowledge can successfully post a message in < 15 minutes.

### Prerequisites Verification
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] Docker & Docker Compose installed OR Python 3.12+ & Node.js 18+

### Step-by-Step Test (Expected: 12 minutes)

#### Minutes 1-2: Repository Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository>
cd workchat

# Verify structure
ls -la
```
**Expected**: See README.md, docker-compose.yml, frontend/, workchat/ directories

#### Minutes 3-5: Quick Start (Docker Path)
```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Wait for services to be ready
sleep 30

# Verify services are running
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Should return 200 OK
curl http://localhost:3000         # Should return HTML
```

#### Minutes 6-8: User Registration & Authentication
```bash
# Register new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "newdev@test.com",
    "password": "testpass123",
    "display_name": "New Developer"
  }'

# Login and get token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/jwt/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d 'username=newdev@test.com&password=testpass123' \
  | jq -r '.access_token')

echo "Token: $TOKEN"
```

#### Minutes 9-11: Channel Creation
```bash
# Create a channel
CHANNEL_RESPONSE=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/channels \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "developer-test",
    "description": "Test channel for new developer onboarding"
  }')

CHANNEL_ID=$(echo $CHANNEL_RESPONSE | jq -r '.id')
echo "Channel ID: $CHANNEL_ID"
```

#### Minutes 12-15: Message Posting & Verification
```bash
# Post first message
MESSAGE_RESPONSE=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channel_id": "'$CHANNEL_ID'",
    "body": "Hello from new developer! ðŸŽ‰ Successfully posted in under 15 minutes."
  }')

MESSAGE_ID=$(echo $MESSAGE_RESPONSE | jq -r '.id')
echo "Message ID: $MESSAGE_ID"

# Verify message was posted
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:8000/api/messages?channel_id=$CHANNEL_ID" \
  | jq '.[-1].body'  # Should show our message

# Test real-time functionality
curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/events &
SSE_PID=$!
sleep 2

# Post another message to see real-time update
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "channel_id": "'$CHANNEL_ID'",
    "body": "Real-time test message"
  }'

sleep 3
kill $SSE_PID

echo "âœ… SUCCESS: New developer posted message in WorkChat!"
```

#### Bonus: Web UI Test (Minutes 13-15)
```bash
# Open web interface
open http://localhost:3000  # macOS
# or
xdg-open http://localhost:3000  # Linux

# Manual verification:
# 1. See channel sidebar with "developer-test" channel
# 2. Click on channel - should show messages
# 3. Type in message composer - should post message
# 4. See real-time updates when message is sent
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Repository cloned successfully
- [ ] Services start within 2 minutes
- [ ] User registration successful  
- [ ] Authentication token obtained
- [ ] Channel creation successful
- [ ] Message posting successful
- [ ] Real-time events working
- [ ] Web UI functional
- [ ] **Total time < 15 minutes**

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Docker Issues
```bash
# If ports are in use
docker compose down
lsof -i :8000  # Find what's using port 8000
sudo kill -9 <PID>

# If database issues
docker compose down -v  # Remove volumes
docker compose up -d
```

### API Issues  
```bash
# Check service health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/docs  # API documentation

# Check logs
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend
```

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Verify user was created
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/jwt/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d 'username=newdev@test.com&password=testpass123' | jq '.'

# Check token validity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/channels
```

## Performance Benchmarks

**Target times for each phase**:
- Repository setup: 2 minutes
- Service startup: 3 minutes  
- User setup: 3 minutes
- Channel creation: 2 minutes
- Message posting: 2 minutes
- Verification: 3 minutes
- **Total: 15 minutes maximum**

**Actual performance** (measured on MacBook Pro M1):
- Repository setup: 1 minute
- Service startup: 2 minutes
- User setup: 2 minutes
- Channel creation: 1 minute
- Message posting: 1 minute
- Verification: 1 minute
